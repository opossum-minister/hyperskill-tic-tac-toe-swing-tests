<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this step, we will teach the computer to play tic-tac-toe. We will add a control panel to our program where you can choose who will play for noughts and crosses. We will also add a start button to start the game.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>You must develop and implement a tic-tac-toe strategy for the computer. The strategy can be as complex, for example as minimax, or the simplest one, where the computer chooses a random free field. You are given complete freedom in choosing a strategy.</p>

<p>A toolbar with three buttons should be added to the program. These are buttons for selecting the first and second player and starting and resetting the game. When you click on the player&#39;s button, the program should switch from a person to a robot and vice versa. The program should support four game modes: human versus human, human versus robot, robot versus human and robot versus robot.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can add a small delay (about a second) when the robot plays. Thus, if you choose to play a robot against a robot, you will be able to observe the process of the game.</p>

<p>Due to testing reasons, you need to name some components.</p>

<p>Set the names to these components:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nine&nbsp; components for cells from &quot;ButtonA1&quot; to &quot;ButtonC3&quot;</li>
    <li>Status bar component to &quot;LabelStatus&quot;</li>
    <li>Player choosers to &quot;ButtonPlayer1&quot; and &quot;ButtonPlayer2&quot;</li>
    <li>Start/Reset button to &quot;ButtonStartReset&quot;</li>
</ul>
