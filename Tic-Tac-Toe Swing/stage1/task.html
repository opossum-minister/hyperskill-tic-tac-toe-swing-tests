<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this project, you will create a simple board game called Tic Tac Toe using Swing for a graphical user interface (GUI). The program will allow you to play both with another player and with a computer. You can also configure the game so that the computer plays against itself, and you will observe the process of the game.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In the first step, you will need to create a simple window with a field for the game. The field in the game consists of 9 cells - three rows of three columns. Each cell is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JButton.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JButton</a> for which you must give a specific name. We will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">algebraic notation</a> to denote each cell in the field. You need to set the name of each component using the JButton::setName method and JButton::setText to display the name on the field as in the example.</p>
