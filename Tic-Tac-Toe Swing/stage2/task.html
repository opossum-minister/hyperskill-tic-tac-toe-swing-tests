<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this step, we will add an event listener for the field cells. The first time you click on a free cell, the &ldquo;X&rdquo; symbol should appear, while the second click on another free cell, the &ldquo;O&rdquo; symbol. We will also add a status bar and a &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; button. When you click on the &quot;Reset&quot; button, the playing field must be cleared. These improvements are enough for you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a friend using the created program.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>You must add a listener for each cell of the field. When you click on a free cell, the symbol &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot; should appear, depending on whose move. If the user clicks on a cell where there is already a character, such a click should be ignored.</p>

<p>The program should track the status of the game. In the event of the end of the game, further pressing on free cells of the field should be ignored. At any time, when you press the &quot;Reset&quot; button, the field should be cleared and the game starts again.</p>

<p>The status field should contain one of the following messages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The game is not started</li>
    <li>The game is playing</li>
    <li>X wins</li>
    <li>O wins</li>
    <li>Draw</li>
</ul>

<p>For testing purposes, you must add names for the following components:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;LabelStatus&quot; for the component where the game status is displayed</li>
    <li>&quot;ButtonReset&quot; for reset button</li>
</ul>

<p>The names for the cells of the playing field should remain the same as in the previous stage. To display symbols, you must set the button text. It must be one of three strings: &ldquo; &ldquo; for an empty cell, &ldquo;X&rdquo; for a first player and &ldquo;O&rdquo; for a second player. <div class="hint">To remove the border around the text of the active cell, use the method <code>setFocusPainted(false)</code> when creating the field cell component.</div></p>

<p>You can set any font, size and color for the cell symbols and any background for the cell itself. The tests only check the names of the components and their text.</p>
